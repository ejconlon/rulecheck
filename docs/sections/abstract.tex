In this paper, we introduce \Rulecheck, a tool for automatically testing the
correctness of rewrite rules in Haskell. Given an arbitrary Haskell package,
\Rulecheck extracts the rules defined in those modules and generates a test suite
containing a property-based test for each rule. \Rulecheck also includes a
synthesis engine to generate well-typed test inputs for the generated tests. We
used \Rulecheck to test \rulestested rules from \packagestested packages on
\Hackage. \Rulecheck was able to find property violations in \rulesfailed of the
resulting tests, indicating potential instances where the corresponding rewrite
rule could change program behaviour.
