In this paper, we introduce \Rulecheck, a tool for automatically testing the
correctness of rewrite rules in Haskell. Given an arbitrary Haskell library,
\Rulecheck extracts the rules defined in the module and generates a test suite
containing a \texttt{QuickCheck} property-based test for each rule. \Rulecheck
also includes a synthesis engine to generate well-typed test inputs for the
generated tests. We evaluated \Rulecheck on several packages from \Hackage, and
found many cases where application of a rewrite rule can result in observable
changes in program output.
