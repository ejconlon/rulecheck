\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We used the Stackage package repository resolver \texttt{lts-19.27} for GHC \texttt{9.0.2} to identify X packages with rewrite rules. \cite{stackage} This represents Y percent of the total packages available in the package set. (The package set itself contains versions of the most popular Haskell libraries and many more in the long tail that are all mutually compatible.)
