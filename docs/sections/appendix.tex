  \section{Division of Tasks}
  For this project, Eric focused on the design and implementation of the program
synthesis engine. He also developed the utilities for automatically downloading
packages from Hackage, and identifying the packages with rewrite rules.

Zack primarily focused on developing the test generation machinery; in
particular, extracting rewrite rules from a package and generating the
corresponding property-based tests. He also implemented the Haddock fork to
produce type definitions for the synthesis engine from Haskell packages.

Eric and Zack contributed equally to the other aspects of the project, including
the in-class presentation and final report.
